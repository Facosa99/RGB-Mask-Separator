# RGB-Mask-Separator
Splits RGB masks into 3 different files for 3D texturing purposes., one for green, one for red, one for blue

An RGB mask can store 3 diferent masks for 3D materials. For example, in a hypothethical case, by isolating the red values of the mask we could get a metalness mask, 
while the green values could store the specular mask and the blue values a roughness mask
